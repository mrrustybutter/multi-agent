# Multi-Agent System Progress Update

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Fixed MCP Server Paths
- Updated rustybutter-avatar and elevenlabs MCP server paths to absolute paths
- All 6 MCP servers now connect successfully (discord-monitor still fails but that's expected)

### 2. Fixed Claude Spawning
- Added `--verbose` flag required for `--output-format stream-json`
- Added `stdin.end()` to properly close the input stream
- Updated to newer Claude model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard is running at http://localhost:8080/simple-dashboard.html
- Dashboard server running on port 3458
- Priority message system is ready for CodingButter

### 4. Queue Processing
- Queue manager successfully detects and deletes messages
- Claude instances are spawning correctly
- Exit codes are now 0 (success) instead of hanging

## Current Status

The orchestrator is operational and can:
- Spawn Claude instances with MCP servers
- Process queue messages from the dashboard
- Connect to 6 MCP servers (semantic-memory, rustybutter-avatar, elevenlabs, twitch-monitor, event-monitor, social-monitor)

## Known Issues

1. **Claude Output Not Visible**: Claude instances are spawning and completing successfully, but their stdout output isn't being captured in the orchestrator logs. This might be due to:
   - The streaming JSON format requiring different parsing
   - Output buffering issues
   - MCP server initialization affecting stdout

2. **Discord Monitor**: Still failing to connect, needs investigation

## Next Steps

1. Fix Claude output capture in orchestrator
2. Properly integrate dashboard-server with dependencies
3. Build persistent browser automation for streaming
4. Fix discord-monitor connection issues

## Testing

To test the system:
1. Send a message through the dashboard at http://localhost:8080/simple-dashboard.html
2. Or create a JSON file in `/orchestrator/queues/` directory
3. Check pm2 logs: `pm2 logs orchestrator`

The system is functional but needs the output capture fixed to see Claude's responses!
